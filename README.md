# Exploring Dimensionality Reduction: PCA, t-SNE, and Autoencoders

Dimensionality reduction techniques play a crucial role in extracting meaningful insights from high-dimensional data. I will delve into three popular techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-Distributed Stochastic neighbour Embedding (t-SNE), and Autoencoders. This discussion will encompass their strengths, limitations, and applications, focusing on the MNIST dataset as an illustrative example.

1.	Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a powerful tool for dimensionality reduction that assumes linear relationships between components, where the change in one feature is directly proportional to the change in another feature within the dataset. Additionally, PCA assumes orthogonality between components, meaning the features are perpendicular to each other.
By identifying the directions or vectors in the data with the highest variance, known as principal components (PCs), PCA captures the most important patterns or variations in the data. The first principal component captures the maximum amount of variance, followed by subsequent components that capture the remaining variance orthogonal to the previously identified components. While PCA is effective in many cases, it may encounter difficulties in capturing complex non-linear relationships present in the data.

2.	t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE): t-SNE is a versatile technique that excels at visualizing high-dimensional data in lower dimensions, typically two or three. Unlike PCA, t-SNE can handle non-linear relationships in the data, enabling the discovery of patterns and similarities. Its visualization output provides clear differentiation between classes or clusters.

PCA preserves the variance in the data, whereas t-SNE preserves the relationships between data points in a lower-dimensional space, making it quite a good algorithm for visualizing complex high-dimensional data.

3.	Autoencoders: Autoencoders are neural network architectures that learn non-linear relationships in high-dimensional data. Comprising an encoder and a decoder, they compress input data into a lower-dimensional representation and reconstruct the original data. Autoencoders excel at preserving information during the decompression process, making them suitable for tasks like image reconstruction or denoising.

**Based on the results obtained from applying these three algorithms (Autoencoder, PCA, and t-SNE) to the MNIST dataset:**

- The Autoencoder was able to preserve more information during the decompression process compared to PCA 2 components. This indicates that the Autoencoder, with its ability to capture non-linear relationships in the data, was better suited for maintaining important features and patterns when reconstructing the images. It can handle the non-linearities present in the data, resulting in a more faithful reconstruction.

- In terms of visualization, t-SNE has provided better results compared to PCA for reducing the high-dimensional data to two dimensions. The visualization produced by t-SNE allows for clearer differentiation between different digit classes, as the clusters of digits are well-separated and distinct. This suggests that t-SNE was able to capture the underlying structure and similarities in the data more effectively, leading to a more visually appealing and informative representation.
